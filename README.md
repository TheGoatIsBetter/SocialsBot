#Why?
I made SocialsBot because the alternative is IfTTT with Zapier, which doesn't always work, presumably due to the amount of API calls it has to make to work for everyone.  This bot was made with uploading it to GitHub for anyone to take and host on their own in mind, so that they only have to worry about their own API calls.  I could be completely wrong here and wasting time, but at least it's something I know inside and out.
